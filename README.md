\
Welcome to my GitHub *CellComp* repository, where you\'92ll find various Python packages 
\f1 \uc0\u55357 \u56333 
\f0 related to my PhD project 
\f1 \uc0\u55357 \u56538 
\f0 at the interface of cancer cell biology, machine learning and software development. **In my research, I focus on the identification of stem-like cells 
\f1 \uc0\u55358 \u56811 
\f0 within non-/cancer cell populations.** With the aid of wide-field & fluorescence microscopy 
\f1 \uc0\u55357 \u56620 
\f0 , deep learning-mediated image segmentation 
\f1 \uc0\u55357 \u56764 \u65039 
\f0 & automated cell tracking 
\f1 \uc0\u55357 \u56419 
\f0 , I am identifying proliferation & differentiation characteristics 
\f1 \uc0\u55357 \u56520 
\f0 which could serve as good predictors of the *stemness* of the cell 
\f1 \uc0\u55358 \u56812

## PhD Project 
\f1 \uc0\u55357 \u56425 \u8205 \u55357 \u56620 
\f0 : Heterogeneity within Non-/Cancer Cell Populations \
\
In this section, you will find my code divided into these sections: \
\
- _(collaborative)_ **Sequitr_Tracker:** my contribution towards a collaborative development of our fully automated movie analysis pipeline for computational processing of the fluorescence movies !!!our 
\f1 \uc0\u55357 \u56425 \u8205 \u55357 \u56507 
\f0 fully automated time-lapse movie analysis pipeline !!!\
- _(independent)_ **Stem_Analysis:** development of pipeline to evaluate the behaviour of cells (division or programmed cell death) captured per single imaging period\
- _(independent)_  **Stem_Analysis:** building of automated tools to extract information (such as cell cycle time, local cell density, intrinsic oscillations, etc.) to identify stem-like cells in cell populations\
\
## Getting Started\
\
### Prerequisites / Dependencies\
\
All code in the *CellComp* repository is written in Python and has been tested with Python 3.7+ on OS X. Most of the packages require the following additional packages:\
\
+ Numpy\
+ Scipy\
+ h5py\
+ matplotlib.pyplot\
+ time\
\
\
### Installation & Usage\
\
Alternatively, to install all the dependencies, run:\
\
`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`\
\
\
### Authors, Acknowledgments & Credits\
\
The code committed to this repository was written by Kristina Ulicna (see the LICENSE.md for more details) and sources from the BayesianTracker library ([Tracker on Github](https://github.com/quantumjot/BayesianTracker)), which is part of the *Sequitr* image processing toolbox for microscopy data analysis, developed by my PhD project advisor, Dr Alan R. Lowe at UCL ([Sequitr on GitHub](https://github.com/quantumjot/sequitr)). For more information see our [CellX group website](http://lowe.cs.ucl.ac.uk/cellx.html).\
\
\
### Project status: _WORK IN PROGRESS_\
\
I have joined the [CellX group](http://lowe.cs.ucl.ac.uk/cellx.html) in late March 2019 for my PhD rotation and have contributed to the project since. I am currently in my 2nd year of the PhD programme at the BBSRC-funded _London Interdisciplinary Doctoral (LIDo) Consortium_ at University College London (UCL). **I am currently in search for PhD internship / placement opportunities in software development and/or machine learning in a health-oriented established company.** If you are interested in getting in touch, please contact me directly via [email](mailto:kristina.smith.ulicna@gmail.com) or check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristinaulicna/) profile. \
